## 🛠️ Installation and Running

### 1. Backend (Flask)

- Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install Flask flask-cors googletrans==3.1.0a0




## 🔥 How It Works
User enters text into the web form (React frontend).

React sends a POST request to the Flask server (/translate) with the text.

Flask uses googletrans to translate the text into English.

Flask sends the translated text back as JSON.

React displays the translated text on the page.

## 📦 Tech Stack
Frontend:

    React.js

    Fetch API

Backend:

    Flask (Python)

    Flask-CORS

    Googletrans library

## ⚠️ Important Notes
Make sure Flask and React servers are running at the same time.

If using a different port, update the API URL in React (fetch('http://127.0.0.1:5000/translate', {...}).

If you see any translation issues, ensure googletrans version is compatible (3.1.0a0 is stable).

## 🌟 Future Improvements
 Add selectable target languages (not just English).

 Add language detection for source text.

 Add loading spinner during translation.

 Deploy backend and frontend to cloud servers (Render, Vercel, etc).

 Improve UI with TailwindCSS or Material UI.
